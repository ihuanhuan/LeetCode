For the following methods , one is the core part, that is to use two pointersã€‚
And in a specific situation, those two will intersect so that we get the answer.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        A = headA
        B = headB
        if not A or not B: return None
        while A!=B:
            if A:
                A = A.next
            else: A = headB
            if B:
                B = B.next
            else: B = headA
        return A
